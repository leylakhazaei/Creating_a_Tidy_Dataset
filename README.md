# Creating_a_Tidy_Dataset
# Script to clean and tidy the Human Activity Recognition dataset 
# obtained from accelerometers of the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.
# The script performs the following steps:
# 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
# 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
# 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
# 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
# 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set 
#    with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
# The final tidy dataset is written to a text file called 'tidy_data.txt'.
