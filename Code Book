Code Book
This code book describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that were performed to clean up the data for the run_analysis.R R script.

Data Source
The data used in this project is based on the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set" experiment that was conducted at the University of California, Irvine. The data can be found at the following URL:

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The data represents measurements collected from the accelerometers and gyroscopes of a Samsung Galaxy S II smartphone worn by 30 individuals as they performed six activities. The activities were as follows:

Walking
Walking Upstairs
Walking Downstairs
Sitting
Standing
Laying
The smartphone captured various measurements related to each activity, such as the acceleration and angular velocity of the body. The data was split into a training dataset (70% of the data) and a test dataset (30% of the data).

Variables
The final tidy dataset contains the following variables:

subject: The ID number of the subject who performed the activity. Range: 1-30.
activity: The type of activity that was performed. Factor variable with 6 levels: Walking, Walking Upstairs, Walking Downstairs, Sitting, Standing, Laying.
